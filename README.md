### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This project enabled me to learn the concepts of promises while while studying the ES6 method of dealing with resolved promises I also grasped the functionality of the async and await keyword when dealing with asynchronous programs and finally most fun part of the project was working with the tile object, learnt how a object component can be created and how the functions are being called but there is still much to digest after this project.
